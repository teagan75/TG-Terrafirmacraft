Terrafirmacraft tutorial

Terrafirmacraft is a mod that overhauls the survival aspect of Minecraft to make it a more rewarding experience. It can be played single player and multiplayer, yet shines with multiplayer. 

 

What most people don't realize is that this is the ultimate community building mod. Farming, animal husbandry, masonry, metallurgy, and prospecting are more involved and can turn into a player's job/role in multiplayer. The more a player does his/her job, the more skilled they become to the point others will rely on them. With the addition of the Merchant's addon, a player driven and balanced economy is attainable.

 

Most mod packs for Terrafirmacraft assumes players have a working knowledge of the mod and are geared toward extending the gameplay for veteran players. This mod pack is different. I have included a quest book to guide players from basic survival to choosing their role in the community (or if playing single player, learning what it takes to run your homestead), then eventually to more technology.
